semalt-block
============

This is a crude attempt to block the Semalt botnet from accessing certain websites. The list is constantly growing and they are using dynamic IP addresses for some of their domain names, so this means some referrals are only blocked for a day or two.

I am trying to find a better way or reducing these visits without having to use this ist.
